# Customized-Product-Dashboards


A large telecommunications company conducts a marketing survey to better understand the perceptions about their products and the competition. Our consulting team has worked with the company to identify a variety of questions to answer. This client would also benefit from building a dynamic reporting engine that can be run as a shiny application in R.

In addition to building these tools, our team would also like you to identify opportunities for the client to make use of the information youâ€™re working with in novel ways.
